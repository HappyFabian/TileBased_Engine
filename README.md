TileBased_Engine
================

Althought this engine was made for study purposes, it MAY  be used for both commercial and personal projects. 
I don't particularly mind you using this code. 

What you may NOT do is to take credit for this code, nor distribute it as if it was yours. 
Give credit where is due. 

You MUST, however, SHARE your changes and explain them in documentation.

You also MUST place any changes of this code into a GitHub repository and place a link back to this repository.



I will be working on a cleaner, more versatile engine in the near future, so remember to follow this repo as well.
